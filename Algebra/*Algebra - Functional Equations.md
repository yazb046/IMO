## Tips for Study

- Start with basic Cauchy-type functional equations to build intuition.  
- Practice substitution and special value techniques.  
- Learn common “standard” functional equations and their solution templates.  
- Explore symmetry and involution properties.  
- Work on problems involving mixed conditions like “either… or…” cases.
