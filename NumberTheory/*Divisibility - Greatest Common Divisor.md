# 📚 Study Guide for IMO 2024 Problem 2

## 🧠 Problem Focus
We are asked to find all pairs \((a, b)\) of positive integers such that there exist constants \(g\) and \(N\) where:
\[
\gcd\left(a^n + b,\; b^n + a\right) = g \quad \text{for all integers } n \geq N
\]

This falls under the domain of **Number Theory**, specifically:
- GCD and divisibility
- Modular arithmetic
- Exponential expressions modulo integers
- Stabilization of number-theoretic functions

## 🧪 Practice Problem Themes

| Topic                    | Example Problem                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GCD of exponential sums  | Prove that \(\gcd(a^n + 1, a^m + 1)\) divides \(a^{\gcd(n, m)} + 1\)             |
| Modular arithmetic       | Show \(a^n \equiv -b \pmod{g} \Rightarrow a^n + b \equiv 0 \pmod{g}\)            |
| Stabilization patterns   | Find all \(a, b\) such that \(\gcd(a^n + b^n, a + b)\) is constant               |
| Growth contradiction     | Show that if \(a \ne b\), then \(\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a)\) is unbounded           |
