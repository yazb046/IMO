This problem falls under the subject of **Number Theory**, specifically dealing with:

- Floor functions and fractional parts  
- Modular arithmetic and divisibility  
- Summation of floor functions  
- Uniform distribution and equidistribution of fractional parts (in some advanced interpretations)  

More precisely, it's a classic type of problem often referred to as dealing with the **Erdős–Szekeres-type properties** or **Beatty sequences**, where you analyze the behavior of sums of floor functions and their divisibility properties.

This problem also borders on **Diophantine analysis**, since it involves finding real numbers \(\alpha\) satisfying integer divisibility constraints for all positive integers \(n\).

So, to summarize, the main subjects are:

- ✅ **Number Theory**  
- ✅ **Floor Functions**  
- ✅ **Modular Arithmetic**  
- ✅ **Summations and Sequences**

This type of problem is common in Olympiad mathematics because it tests both ingenuity and deep understanding of how real numbers interact with integer functions.


### Key Concepts to Solve the IMO Floor Function Divisibility Problem

1. **Understanding the Floor Function:**
    
    - Know how to decompose a real number into its integer part and fractional part.
        
    - Understand that `floor(k * alpha)` can be written as `k * a + floor(k * theta)`, where `a` is integer and `theta` is fractional part of alpha.
        
2. **Modular Arithmetic & Divisibility:**
    
    - Understand divisibility conditions, especially how sums behave modulo `n`.
        
    - Recognize how terms like `a * n(n+1)/2` behave mod `n`.
        
3. **Summations of Floor Functions:**
    
    - Be familiar with properties of sums involving floor functions.
        
    - Understand how summations break down into integer and fractional parts.
        
4. **Beatty Sequences:**
    
    - Know the definition and properties of Beatty sequences, which are sequences of the form `floor(n * alpha)`.
        
    - Understand the Beatty Theorem: For irrational positive `alpha` and `beta` with `1/alpha + 1/beta = 1`, the sequences `floor(n * alpha)` and `floor(n * beta)` partition the natural numbers without overlap.
        
    - Know how Beatty sequences relate to the golden ratio and why they are special in divisibility problems.
        
5. **Uniqueness Argument:**
    
    - Use contradiction and properties of rational vs irrational numbers to show no other `alpha` works.
        
    - Understand periodicity of floor functions when `alpha` is rational.
        
6. **Number Theory Intuition:**
    
    - Be comfortable thinking about sums, divisibility, sequences, and fractional parts.
        
    - Recognize that certain special numbers (like `(sqrt(5) - 1)/2`) often arise in such problems due to their unique algebraic and number-theoretic properties.
