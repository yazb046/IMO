# Solution Pattern for Covering Points with Lines (Geometric Combinatorics)

## 1. Understand the Set of Points
- Clearly identify the set of points given (e.g., all \( (a,b) \) with \( a,b \geq 1 \) and \( a + b \leq n + 1 \)).  
- Calculate the total number of points:  
  \[
  \text{Total points} = 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
  \]

---

## 2. Classify the Types of Lines
- Horizontal lines (parallel to the x-axis)  
- Vertical lines (parallel to the y-axis)  
- Diagonal lines (e.g., lines of form \( x + y = \text{const} \))  
- Other lines (often called *sunny* lines)

---

## 3. Estimate the Coverage Capacity of Each Line
- Identify "long" lines that pass through the maximum number of points (e.g., \( n \) points).  
- Determine the minimum number of such lines required to cover all points.

---

## 4. Analyze Extreme Cases
- Is it possible to cover all points without any *sunny* lines? (i.e., \( k=0 \))  
- Is it possible to cover all points using only *sunny* lines? (maximum possible \( k \))

---

## 5. Construct Examples
- Provide explicit constructions of sets of \( n \) lines that cover all points.  
- Count how many *sunny* lines each construction contains.

---

## 6. Use Induction or Reduction
- For large \( n \), reduce the problem to smaller \( n \) (e.g., \( n=3 \)) to analyze all cases.  
- Use the base cases to understand possible values of \( k \).

---

## 7. Prove Impossibility of Other Cases
- Demonstrate logically or via counting arguments why other values of \( k \) cannot occur.

---

## Summary
- Count points  
- Categorize lines  
- Build constructions  
- Use induction  
- Prove constraints  
- Conclude possible values of parameters like \( k \)
